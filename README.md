# Ledger Nano PIV Application

TODO

## Building

```
cargo build --release
```

## Loading

You can use [cargo-ledger](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/cargo-ledger.git) which
builds, outputs a `hex` file and a manifest file for `ledgerctl`, and loads it
on a device in a single `cargo ledger load` command in your app directory.

## Testing

One can for example use [speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos).

In a first console:
```
cargo run
```
In a second one:
```
pytest test/ -v -s
```
